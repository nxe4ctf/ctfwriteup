# picoCTF 2017: Bash Loop

**Level:** 1 **Category:** BINARY EXPLOITATION **Point:** 40 **Description:**

>We found a program that is hiding a flag but requires you to guess the number it is thinking of. Chances are Linux has an easy way to try all the numbers... Go to /problems/de905332a1594a49f78931c233b0eb2b and try it out!

**Hint:**

>Either use SSH or use the Web Shell to get onto the shell server and navigate to the correct directory. Then do a quick Google search on 'bash loops'. You may need to use grep to filter out the responses as well!

## Write-up


``` 
$ for i in {0..4096} 
> do ./bashloop $i | grep "flag"                                             
> done                                                                       
Yay! That's the number! Here be the flag: c5d35a85c2c2ea7c69a84f6756f57bb1
```

So the flag is `c5d35a85c2c2ea7c69a84f6756f57bb1`.
