# picoCTF 2017: LeakedHashes

**Level:** 2 **Category:** CRYPTOGRAPHY **Point:** 90 

**Description:**

>Someone got hacked! Check out some service's password hashes that were leaked at [hashdump.txt](https://github.com/nxe4ctf/ctfwriteup/blob/master/picoCTF_2017/Level_2/CRYPTOGRAPHY/SoRandom/sorandom.py)! Do you think they chose strong passwords? We should check... The service is running at shell2017.picoctf.com:44804!

**Hint:**

>See if you can crack any of the login credentials and then connect to the service as one of the users. What's the chance these hashes have actually already been broken by someone else? Are there websites that host those cracked hashes? Connect from the shell with nc.

## Write-up

Using the website `[http://www.cmd5.com/](http://www.cmd5.com/)`, the password of the `root` user hasn't been cracked so far. However, the password of the `nadia` user has been cracked. It's `sch4h`. So using this set of username and password to connect to the server.

``` 
root@kali:~/Desktop# nc shell2017.picoctf.com 44804
enter username:
nadia
nadia's password:sch4h
